# Social media
Social media is quickly becoming the largest medium for marketing. It’s no longer just a social platform it’s now also a business platform. The risks encountered while using these services are numerous, and anyone can be targeted. You’re most likely aware of some of the ways you can defend yourself against attack. Below is a list detailing various methods of security when using social media, or an account-based website:
Multi-Factor Authentication – Multi-factor Authentication is a relatively new arrival to security. If anyone logs into your account, they will be asked to provide a code. This code will be sent to a specified external device, or other 3rd party software.  This is simple to set up and essential to your security in today’s climate.
Password Security – The strength of your password is very important. “johnbaker” is not a very good password for obvious reasons. You should never include your personal details in a password, and this is also true for your email. Things like your name, DOB, and place of birth are incredibly easy to determine. This is due to you having to provide this information when registering for most online services.  For these reasons it is important to have a password devoid of personal information. An example of this would be “Gijfigbig67”. Including capitals, Random letters and numbers within your password means that you have completely removed a potentially massive risk. 
Another essential, but simple, practice is updating your password regularly, and also ensuring you don’t use the same password for multiple accounts.  The reason being if they access one account, and obtain your password they potentially have access to your other accounts.
Know your Friends –  It’s important to curate your friends list for people that you don’t know. Many fake accounts prowl social media and it’s important that you know who you are adding. Don’t get into the habit of simulating a large friends list. In terms of online security, you are increasing the risk of spam, phishing links, and more.

# Trackers






Trackers
When surfing on the net, you will venture onto lots of sites that you will get comfy with, whether it’s for work, research or just to watch a couple of videos. What you might not know is that most sites have trackers owned by third party companies, collecting a range of data related to our activity, such as the like button on Facebook and various advertisements. Trackers can see all kinds of details and can associate them to help recognise you. This can be used to show specific advertisements and track you down to the sites you go on, without you knowing.
To prevent the use of trackers, one such method will be using your browser’s incognito mode, that eliminates the trackers from being used. Other such methods can be add-ons that can be used on your browser that can also prevent trackers from being used.
