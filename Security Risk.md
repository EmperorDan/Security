# What are the risks?

## Disgruntled Employees
One of the largest threats to an organisation is their employees. With the level of trust and access that certain employees have within comes huge risks. The main risks come from the IT department as they have access to the organisations networks, and accounts. Its important to manage the morale of your employees as a disgruntled employee with enough access can cripple a company/organisation.

## Careless or Uninformed Employees
This reinforces the reasoning behind the interview process. You must communicate with your employee's/colleage's. Mistakes will be avoided if you keep that line of communication open, and make sure they know your aware of their work.

## Mobile Devices
Mobile devices allow you to access most data you would on your computer. This is becoming a massive problem for buisnesses, so much so, that now some are questioning thier BYOD policy (Bring Your Own Device). This makes sense as employees will often access sensitive information, regarding their company/buisness, on their phone. This leaves that information vulnerable because, lets be honest, most people don't update their passwords, and even more leave their email logged in. These many factors can make this one of the most damaging of the vulnerabilities listed here.   

## Cloud Applications
When storing information on a cloud server you open your self up to threats, that could massively harm your companies privacy. Data encryption is essential when using a cloud based server. The most popular being AES 256-bit which is regarded as the "Crypto gold standard". With AES 256-bit the encryption keys are held exclusivesly, keeping it out of the hands of third parties, which in turn provides you with a higher level of security.

## Third-party Service Providers
Maintaning a buisness nowadays comes with an immense workload. Because of this, many buisnesses outsource the maintenance of their Point-of-Sale (POS) systems to third party companies. The issue with this is that many of these companies aren't as diligent, as you are, with your information. These companies may be using the same password with multiple clients leaving yours, and other buisnesses vulnerable. The employees of these companies don't have as much to lose as you do, and with that their comes the risk of them potentially selling, and or compromising your information.

## Security Procedures
- Strong passwords that include symbols, capitals, and numbers. Passwords you create for work should be completely random. 
- Controlling access means that your employees can only access, what is authorised by you.
- Set up firewalls to block most viruses, malware, and other nefarious actions.
- Update security programs, and software regularly.
- Make employees aware of risk.

## How Implementing a DMZ, Static IP and NAT in a Network can Improve Network Security
### DMZ
A DMZ is the buffer between the internet, and your internal Network.  While your network may have a firewall it's still vulnerable to compromised software, such as a web server. An attacker could potentially gain access to your local network. They will take advantage of the ports that would be open within said software. A DMZ is created by setting up each portion of your network on different IP Network's 

### Static IP
Static IP addresses are fixed unlike the dynamic IP. Having a static IP allows a user to retrieve information from the server using various devices. 

### NAT
Network Address Translation resolves multiple IP addresses into one address. It was introduced to solve the limited space issue when using IPV4.
