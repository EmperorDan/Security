# What are the risks?

## Disgruntled Employees
One of the largest threats to an organisation is their employees. With the level of trust and access that certain employees have within comes huge risks. The main risks come from the IT department as they have access to the organisations networks, and accounts. Its important to manage the morale of your employees as a disgruntled employee with enough access can cripple a company/organisation.

## Careless or Uninformed Employees
This reinforces the reasoning behind the interview process. You must communicate with your employee's/colleage's. Mistakes will be avoided if you keep that line of communication open, and make sure they know your aware of their work.

## Mobile Devices
Mobile devices allow you to access most data you would on your computer. This is becoming a massive problem for buisnesses, so much so, that now some are questioning thier BYOD policy (Bring Your Own Device). This makes sense as employees will often access sensitive information, regarding their company/buisness, on their phone. This leaves that information vulnerable because, lets be honest, most people don't update their passwords, and even more leave their email logged in. These many factors can make this one of the most damaging of the vulnerabilities listed here.
